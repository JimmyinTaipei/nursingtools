Targeting variables (e.g., age and Braden Scale Risk Category) can focus assessment on particular risk factors (e.g., pressure) and help guide the plan of prevention and care (McCulloch & Kloth, 2010; NPUAP/EPUAP, 2014; Sussman & Bates-Jensen, 2012).</p>

The following classification system and definition is for pressure ulcers: Pressure ulcer: localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear (NOTE: Friction is not included in the definition) (NPUAP/EPUAP, 2014).</p>
                    <p class="rationale">
                        ❍ Category/Stage I: Intact skin with nonblanchable erythema of a localized area, usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching. The area may be painful, firm, soft, warmer, or cooler than adjacent tissue. Category/Stage I may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones and may indicate "at risk" persons.<br>
                        ❍ Category/Stage II: Partial-thickness skin loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough, that may also present as intact or open/ruptured and serum-filled. Presents as a shiny or dry shallow ulcer without slough or bruising. This category/stage should not be used to describe skin tears, tape burns, incontinence-associated dermatitis, maceration, or excoriation.<br>
                        ❍ Bruising may indicate suspected deep tissue injury; for wounds deeper into subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone (category/stage III or stage IV pressure ulcers), see the care plan for Impaired Tissue integrity (NPUAP/EPUAP, 2014).
